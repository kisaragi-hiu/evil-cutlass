* evil-cutlass

Evil port of [[https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-cutlass][vim-cutlass]].

** Set up

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package '(evil-cutlass
                        :repo "https://github.com/kisaragi-hiu/evil-cutlass"))
(evil-cutlass-mode)
#+end_src

Now =x= will cut text into the default register (like =d= originally), while other evil commands will not edit the register by default.

="= (=evil-use-register=) still works, so ="adw= still cuts the word into the a register.
